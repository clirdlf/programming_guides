# Website Redesign

This project will be broken into a different phases. This document will
help structure the process as we move toward launches our redesigned web
interfaces.

## Stage 1: Strategy

The goal of this phase is to ensure we understand why we are doing this
site redesign, what is going on now with our web traffic, who our audience
 is, and where we stand in the larger field of library non-profits.

These are the framing questions we need to answer:

### Benchmark Current Metrics

* What is the average number of unique visitors?
* What is the average bounce rate (visitors who view one page and leave)?
* What is the average time on our site?
* What are the top performing keywords?
* What is the number of inbound linking domains?
* What is the average number of new subscriptions (aka new leads)
* What is the total number of pages indexed?
* What is the total number of pages that receive traffic?

### Goals

* Why are we doing this redesign?
* What do we hope happens with this redesign?

### Defining Our Brand

* What is our message to the outside world?
* Is our messaging/branding changin?
* If it's changing, what needs to change about it?

### Our Audience

* Who is our target audience? (e.g. librarians, deans, provosts)
* What are the top 3 keywords for library non-profits?
* Who are our top-ranked "competitors"

## Stage 2: Planning

In this stage, we need to take a hard look at our websites and ask these
questions:

### General Considerations

* What do you currently like/dislike about the current website?
* What is missing from the current website?
* How does our current site compare to our goals?
* What's the first impression we should give to our target audience?
* Does our site currently convey a feeling of authority and
  trustworthyness?
* What is a realistic timeline for this redesign?
* What is the budget for the project?
* Can we do this work in-house or do we need to hire someone?

### Platform Considerations

* What platforms are we evaluating?
* Does the platform have a good reputation?
* Does the platform have good deliverability? (e.g site speed & uptime)
* Is the platform SEO-friendly? (e.g well structured URLs)?
* Is it easy to hire developers to work on the platform?

### Inventory

* What is the most shared or viewed content?
* What are the most trafficked pages?
* What are the most ranked pages?
* Do we have any duplicate content?

### Site Architecture

* Plan the new site architecture/structure
* Define which pages will be part of the main/secondary navigation
* Put together a draft outline/sitemap of the new website

### Hosting and Security

* Where will the site be hosted?
* Do we need a CDN?

### Planning URL Mapping and Redirects

* Will pages be merged?

**Task:** Map our URLs/redirects in a spreadsheet

### Define a Content Plan

* Outline what content will stay
* Outline what content will go
* Outline which content needs to be rewritten
* Identify what new calls-to-action need to be added
